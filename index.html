      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      I am currently a PhD student in <a href="https://safari.ethz.ch/">Safari Research Group</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/">ETH Zurich</a> led by <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/">Prof. Onur Mutlu</a>. 
      I completed my BSc and Msc degrees in Computer Engineering at TOBB ETU under supervision of Prof. Oguz Ergin. 


      I am broadly interested in <emph>computer architecture</emph> and tackling interesting problems of current and future systems.
      My recent work focuses on <emph>memory systems</emph>, particularly their security, reliability, and safety (<emph>robustness</emph>), and designing effective and efficient solutions to address robustness issues. 
      Recently, I have been working on <emph>low cost and scalable RowHammer mitigation techniques</emph> to improve the robustness of DRAM-based computing systems. I am also interested in exploring the robustness of emerging computing paradigms and future systems, such as <emph>processing-in-memory</emph>, against hardware vulnerabilities.
      
      <p>Previously, I worked on extending a cycle-level DRAM simulator,  <a href="https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator">Ramulator</a>, 
        with 1) <a href="https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator/tree/master/trace_generator">a CPU instruction and memory request trace generator tool</a> based on <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool.html">Intel Pin</a> to alleviate performance overheads of simulating modern systems 
        and 2) emerging memory technology models such as <emph>STT-RAM</emph> and <emph>PCM</emph> enabling accurate simulations for these memory technologies. 

      <p>Before starting my PhD, I was a member of the <a href="https://www.kasirgalabs.com/en/">Kasirga Microprocessors' Lab</a> in TOBB ETU. Between the years of 2016 and 2022, I had the chance lead and contribute to many exciting projects, including various <emph>RISC-V-based processor and microcontroller designs</emph>.
