      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      I am currently a Research and Teaching Assistant at <a href="https://www.etu.edu.tr">TOBB University of Economics and Technology</a>. I am broadly interested in <emph>computer architecture</emph>. I worked on memory (DRAM and hybrid memory systems), and hardware software codesigns, and I am currently interested in hardware security and machine learning solutions for computer architecture problems. Most recently, my paper  <emph>"DR-STRANGE: End-to-End System Design for DRAM True Random Number Generators"</emph> got accepted to <a href="https://hpca-conf.org/2022/">HPCA 2022</a>. 
      
      <p>I joined <a href="https://www.kasirgalabs.com/en/">Kasirga Microprocessors' Lab</a> in 2016 during my first year as a Bachelor's student at TOBB ETU. Since then, I had the chance to work on many exciting projects including two <emph>RISC-V</emph> processor design projects using <emph>Chisel3</emph> and <emph>Verilog</emph>. Besides the hardware design projects, I worked on system- and memory-level simulation using system and DRAM simulators for an <emph>energy-efficient DRAM refresh mechanism</emph> project.
  
      <p>I joined <a href="https://safari.ethz.ch/">Safari Research Group</a> led by <a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/omutlu/">Prof. Onur Mutlu</a> at <a href="https://ethz.ch/de.html">ETH Zurich </a>in 2018. During my internships, I worked <i>(i)</i> on  a hardware design project focused on cross-layer communication, and <i>(ii)</i> on software tools to enable accurate and fast system-level simulation. I contributed to <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08123">a metadata management infrastructure</a> project that has a RISC-V prototype. I built <emph>a CPU and memory trace generator tool</emph> based on <emph>Intel Pin</emph> to alleviate simulation overheads and created data dependency and cache models to increase simulation accuracy. I also worked on extending <a href="https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/ramulator">Ramulator</a>, a cycle accurate DRAM simulator, with emerging memory technologies such as <emph>STT-RAM</emph> and <emph>PCM</emph> enabling accurate simulations for these devices.
